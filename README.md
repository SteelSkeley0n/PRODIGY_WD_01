This project is a responsive, visually engaging single-page website designed to introduce users to the sport of basketball. It combines modern web development techniques using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a vibrant user experience. The site includes a fixed navigation bar, dynamic background transitions on scroll, and an interactive "Back to Top" button. The content covers the history of basketball, its cultural appeal, and future innovations, all wrapped in a thematic design that mirrors the energy and color of the game. It's ideal as a portfolio piece for showcasing front-end skills and creative UI thinking.
